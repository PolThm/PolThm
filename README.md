# Hello, I’m a French Full-Stack Developer with a strong Front-End focus

As an experienced Full-Stack developer with a Front-End specialization, I work extensively with TypeScript across React.js, React Native and Vue.js. I’m a strong advocate of Clean Code and place great importance on quality and maintainability (unit testing, documentation, architecture, etc.).

With strong back-end fundamentals, I keep expanding these skills to complement my Front-End expertise and ensure the delivery of reliable, cohesive end-to-end solutions.

A determined communicator with a passion for solving complex challenges—whether in an agile team or independently—I’m always seeking new opportunities to learn, grow, and share knowledge within the development community.
