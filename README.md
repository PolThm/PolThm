# Hello, Iâ€™m a French developer specializing in Front-End with TypeScript, expanding my skills to become Full-Stack.

As a Typescript specialist in Vue.js, React.js, and React Native, I am a fervent advocate of Clean Code and place great importance on its quality and maintainability (unit tests, documentation, architecture, etc).

With the ambition to become a competent Full-Stack developer, I am currently developing my skills in Node.js to complement my Front-End expertise and get more involved in server-side development.

A determined communicator, with a passion for solving complex challenges in an agile team or independently, I am always looking for new opportunities to develop and share my knowledge in the field of development.
